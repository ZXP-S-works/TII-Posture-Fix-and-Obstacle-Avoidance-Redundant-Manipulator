# End-Effector Posture-Maintaining and Obstacle-Limits Avoidance Schemes for Redundant Robot Manipulators
## Abstract

To fulfill path tracking tasks with the end-effector posture controlled in a complex environment, maintaining the robot manipulator end-effector's posture and avoiding obstacles are two important issues needed to be considered. In this paper, two hybrid end-effector posture-maintaining and obstacle-limits avoidance (hybrid PM-OLA) schemes are proposed and investigated for motion planning of redundant robot manipulators, which are based on the quadratic programming (QP) framework. The end-effector posture-maintaining, obstacle-avoidance, and the joint-angular-limits are formulated as an equality constraint, an inequality and bound constraints into the QP problem.
With this hybrid PM-OLA scheme, the robot manipulator can avoid the obstacle and joint physical limits when executing end-effector tasks. The hybrid PM-OLA scheme is finally transformed into a linear-variation-inequations (LVI) and solved by a recurrent neural network (RNN). Computer simulations and physical experiments substantiate the effectiveness, accuracy, safety and the practicability of the proposed hybrid PM-OLA scheme. Comparisons with other schemes show that the proposed hybrid PM-OLA scheme is more suitable for applications.
